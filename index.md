## Overview
I am a graduate researcher in MRI engineering, with a focus on acquisition and post-processing pipelines. My thesis aims to leverage current advances in MRI hardware to make a non-invasive quantitative neuroimaging method called CEST useful in research and clinical contexts. I have experience in creating and implementing advanced processing pipelines to quantitative MRI data. Outside of research and technical work, I have some experience in early-stage start-up management and navigating the APAC medtech ecosystem, and experience in mobilising peer groups to create effective policy changes for the safety of young people.
